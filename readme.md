# Lab Checker
This is application for automatic program testing.  
Each test consists of 
- input file (that is redirected to stdin)  
- output file (that is redirected to stdout)  

This application does not include those files,  
acquire them by autogenerating or by your professor or somehow.

Your program should take input (if any) from stdin, and write result (if any) to stdout.  
You can use stderr for logging.  
If program exits with exit code != 0, this is considered failed execution.  

Python (probably version â‰¥ 3.8) is required.  
For GUI app, Python's tkinter is required.  
There is no non GUI app, but it is (probably) very easy to make using Modules/Abstract.py.
