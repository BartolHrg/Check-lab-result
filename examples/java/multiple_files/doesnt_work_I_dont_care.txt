works with .java option if .in and .out files are in the same folder as Prog.java
workarounds:
	in LabCheckerGUI.py in class LabCheckerGUI in function test
		when calling self.callCommand,
		first argument in calling os.path.dirname
		replace `filegroup["input"]` with `self.program_var.get()`
		maybe, idk, didn't test, don't care
	use jar
	use script
